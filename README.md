# Whatsapp Group Chat Inference Generator

Running this code will generate 2 pdfs, one general statistical analysis, and one individual personality analysis.  
Note that generating the second pdf is optional.  

## Instructions to run

Create a WhatsApp chat export and save it to a .txt file on your pc  
Save everyone's numbers before exporting, and ensure there are no duplicate first names.  The code truncates names to use the first name.  
Install all the packages mentioned in requirements.txt  
Open the .ipynb and look at the first cell  
Change all the values in the first cell as per your requirement  
Run all cells in the .ipynb file  

## Side notes

Whatsapp changes export formats randomly.  
This code works for exports made on 13th July 2025, but I cannot guarantee its functioning in the future
